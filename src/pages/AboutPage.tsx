              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                Stryve Learning was founded by a group of high-achieving
                students who noticed a significant trend in the vagueness of
                other tutoring services and wanted to bridge the gap and create
                FREE online tutoring, for more niche subjects. We believe that
                peer-to-peer learning creates a unique environment where
                students feel more comfortable asking questions and taking
                risks.

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6">
                What started as a small idea turned into a national success,
                amassing 4000 enrollments in our most recent year. We're not
                just tutors, we are students ourselves and know how to teach as
                we've overcame that sturggle before.
